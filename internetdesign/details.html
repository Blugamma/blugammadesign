            <h1 id="detailsH1">Course Details</h1>
            <p class="IDcontentP">Internet Design encompasses much more than just simple website creation. It is concerned with complex social, technical and cultural systems which pervade modern society, of which "The Web" forms only small, shallow part.</p>

            <p class="IDcontentP">We use the term "internet" to refer to a broad range of technological infrastructure, services, data sources, devices and software that are embedded in our homes, that will carry with us in our pockets and that have such a major influence the way we live our lives. Graduates from this program will emerge with deep understanding of the construction of these systems - not just limited to the application layer, but also the fundamental communication mechanisms, data storage schemes, as well as central and decentralised architectures.</p>

            <p class="IDcontentP">Students will become Full Stack Hackers - proficient in design, markup, styling, dynamic behaviour and complex network programming. They will push the boundaries of what is possible on the web, on mobile, on embedded systems and on other emerging platforms.</p>

            <p class="IDcontentP">They will be the ones who will design and develop the next generation of Internet systems and will have a hand in shaping all of our digital futures.</p>

            <p class="IDcontentP">Though optional, it is strongly recommended you take a placement year as it will provide you with a broader range of skills to appreciate your final year in the context of real world development. Many employers take on a placement student with the option of recruiting them when they graduate. Typically, you could earn around £15,000–£20,000 depending on the location and type of work.</p>

You'll also be provided with the opportunity to customise your degree to a specific area of interest through a major element of the final year project.</p>
            <p class="IDcontentP">Every undergraduate taught course has a detailed programme specification document describing the course aims, the course structure, the teaching and learning methods, the learning outcomes and the rules of assessment.</p>
